How to make it work:

    1. Create a separate directory and download all these files into the same directory

    2. Download the following 2 files:
        1) CPMF.py: Main file for training CPMF
        2) u.data: MovieLens 100k data set
    3. Run CPMF.py



I did not try to optimize this code, but please e-mail me if you find bugs.


I am also very glad to communicate with you by e-mail about your problems.
